This repository contains a simple snake game built with Lua and LÃ–VE (Love2D). I built this to learn and have fun, so the code is designed to be self-explanatory without any comments. To run the game, make sure you have Lua and Love2D installed properly, then navigate to the root directory of the repository and run the command `lovec .`.
